This output shows the best-performing Finite State Automaton (FSA) from your genetic algorithm after some generations of evolution. Let me break down what each part means:
Overall Structure
8 States: The FSA has 8 different states (numbered 0-7)
Fitness: 360.6 - This individual survived for about 3606 frames (360.6 ÷ 0.1) and likely hit some blocks
Each State Contains:
Transitions Array (64 elements each)
Each state has 64 transition rules because there are 2^6 = 64 possible input combinations
The 6 inputs are: [ball left third, ball right third, ball lower area, paddle left of ball, ball moving right, ball moving down]
Each number (0-7) tells the FSA which state to go to next based on the current input combination
For example, in State 0:
Input combination 0 (000000 in binary) → go to state 4
Input combination 1 (000001 in binary) → go to state 3
Input combination 2 (000010 in binary) → go to state 4
And so on...
Action
-1: Move paddle left
0: Don't move paddle
1: Move paddle right
What This FSA Does:
Looking at the actions:
State 0: Always moves left (-1)
State 1: Always moves right (1)
State 2: Always moves right (1)
State 3: Always moves left (-1)
State 4: Stays still (0)
State 5: Always moves right (1)
State 6: Stays still (0)
State 7: Stays still (0)
The FSA switches between these behaviors based on the ball and paddle positions. The complex transition table means it has learned specific responses to different game situations - for example, it might move right when the ball is in the left third and moving toward the paddle, but stay still when the ball is moving away.
This particular FSA achieved a fitness of 360.6, meaning it survived reasonably well and possibly hit some blocks during its game!
